Hi everyone! It's a simple site according to the exercise from edX's course Microsoft: DEV284x / Designing a Technical Solution. 

The pages are:
- static for now, in the future I will put some more advanced code :)
- coded with HTML and CSS
- checked only in Opera and Edge

The pages contain:
- a few comments to explain some solutions
- some responsive elements - elements are coded according to their (good or not-good) looking

My tasks in the future:
- checking the site in other browsers 
- maybe adding some beautification (:
- adding responsive elements according to general responsive guidelines
- shortening the code
- implementation of SASS
- adding more dynamic solutions (JS etc.)

Tasks already done:
- adding prefixes where they are needed
- fixing pages for IE11+
