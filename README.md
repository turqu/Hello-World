Hi everyone! It's a simple site according to the exercise from edX's course Microsoft: DEV284x / Designing a Technical Solution. 

The pages are:
- static for now, in the future I will put some more advanced code :)
- coded with HTML and CSS
- checked only in Opera, Edge and IE10+
- mobile: checked on Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime

The pages contain:
- a few comments to explain some solutions
- some responsive elements

My tasks in the future:
- checking the site in other browsers 
- maybe adding some beautification (:
- shortening the code
- implementation of SASS
- adding more dynamic solutions (JS etc.)

Tasks already done:
- adding prefixes where they are needed
- fixing pages for IE10+
- shortening the code (for now)
- adding and corrected responsive elements (missing meta tag about viewports etc.)
